# Webcrawler

A webcrawler to check websites or parts for updates.  
It can be configured using a json config as shown in [/config.json](/config.json).
All available functions can be found in
[/crawler/default\_functions.py](/crawler/default_functions.py).  
I will add some documentation as soon as I can but don't hold your breath.
